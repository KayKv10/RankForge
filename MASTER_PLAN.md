# Project Master Plan: RankForge - Competitive Gaming Analytics Platform

## Executive Summary

RankForge is a modern, game-agnostic rating and matchmaking system designed to track player performance across any competitive format (1v1, 1vN, MvN). The project serves dual purposes: providing a fun, competitive experience for tracking performance among friends, and functioning as a portfolio showcase demonstrating expertise across mathematics, data science, software development, and frontend skills.

The project has a **functional but not production-ready backend** with a working FastAPI application, complete Glicko-2 rating implementation, and flexible data models. However, a deep code analysis reveals **significant technical debt and architectural issues** that must be addressed before building on this foundation. Critical problems include: broken transaction management that can leave matches and ratings in inconsistent states, missing database indexes, unvalidated JSON schemas, hardcoded configuration, and incomplete error handling. The codebase scores approximately **4.5/10 on production readiness**.

Beyond code quality, the project is missing critical components: **no frontend exists**, **no matchmaking algorithm is implemented**, **no leaderboard/analytics endpoints are available**, and match update operations (a core challenge) have no implementation or design. The update cascade problem—recalculating all affected ratings when a historical match is corrected—is a non-trivial architectural challenge that requires careful design.

The path to MVP completion requires approximately **309-348 hours of development** across five major phases: foundation refactoring (Phase 0), matchmaking and match updates (Phase 1), frontend development (Phase 2), deployment (Phase 3), and documentation (Phase 4). At 3-6 hours per week, this translates to roughly **18-24 months** of dedicated work. Phase 0 is significantly expanded (122 hours) to establish a truly production-quality foundation before adding new features.

## Current State Assessment

### What's Implemented

**Backend Infrastructure (Functional, Not Production-Ready)**
- FastAPI async web application with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 ORM with async support (aiosqlite for development)
- Alembic database migrations for schema versioning
- Basic separation of concerns: API routes, schemas, services, models
- *Note: See "Critical Code Quality Issues" section for production-readiness gaps*

**Data Models (Complete)**
- `Player` - Unique person across all games
- `Game` - Defines competitive game structure with pluggable rating strategy
- `GameProfile` - Player's rating and stats for a specific game (flexible JSON fields)
- `Match` - Single instance of a game with contextual metadata
- `MatchParticipant` - Links players to matches with outcomes and rating history

**API Endpoints (13 Endpoints)**
- Players: Full CRUD (POST, GET list, GET single, PUT, DELETE)
- Games: Full CRUD (POST, GET list, GET single, PUT, DELETE)
- Matches: Create, Read list, Read single, Delete

**Rating System**
- Complete Glicko-2 implementation ([glicko2_engine.py](src/rankforge/rating/glicko2_engine.py))
- Based on Mark Glickman's paper with proper mathematical implementation
- Supports binary (win/loss) and ranked outcomes
- Team-based calculations with proper opponent aggregation
- Historical rating tracking (before/after each match)

**Code Quality Infrastructure**
- Pre-commit hooks with Ruff (linting/formatting) and Mypy (type checking)
- Comprehensive test suite (~1,200 lines across 7 test modules)
- Async-first testing with pytest-asyncio
- In-memory test database with transactional isolation

**Data Import System**
- 24+ data import scripts for real-world match history (Pickleball, Tennis, Padel)
- Demonstrates API usage patterns and real data structures

### What's In Progress

- **Rating Strategy Dispatcher**: Architecture exists for multiple rating engines; currently routes to Glicko-2 or dummy engine based on game's `rating_strategy` field
- **Match History Tracking**: Basic structure in place (rating_info_before, rating_info_change), but no dedicated history retrieval endpoints

### What's Missing

**Core Features Needed for MVP**
1. **Leaderboard/Rankings Endpoints** - No endpoints to retrieve sorted player rankings by game
2. **Player Statistics Endpoints** - No endpoints for win/loss records, match history per player
3. **Game Profile Retrieval** - No endpoints to get all players' ratings for a specific game
4. **Matchmaking System** - Zero implementation; this is the novel algorithm (distribution superposition + simulated annealing)
5. **Frontend Application** - No frontend code exists whatsoever
6. **User Authentication** - No auth system (acceptable for friends-only use, but needed for public deployment)

**Infrastructure Gaps**
1. **No production deployment configuration** - No Dockerfile, docker-compose, or cloud deployment manifests
2. **No environment configuration** - Empty `.env` file, hardcoded SQLite database path
3. **No API rate limiting or security hardening**
4. **No monitoring, logging, or health check endpoints**

**Documentation/Testing Gaps**
1. **No API usage examples** - README covers setup but not how to use the API
2. **No architecture documentation** - No diagrams or detailed system explanations
3. **No user guide** - No documentation for end users
4. **Limited integration tests** - Most tests are unit/service level, fewer end-to-end API tests

### Technical Debt & Refactoring Needs

1. **Import Scripts Cleanup** - 24 versions of pickleball import script should be consolidated into a single configurable importer
2. **Database URL Hardcoding** - Currently hardcoded in [session.py](src/rankforge/db/session.py); should use environment variables
3. **Error Handling Consistency** - Some edge cases (e.g., non-competitive matches) have TODO comments rather than proper error handling
4. **Pydantic Schema Expansion** - Current schemas don't expose rating info in player responses; need GameProfile schemas for leaderboard use
5. **Type Annotations** - Some function parameters lack full type hints
6. **Test Coverage for Glicko-2** - Mathematical edge cases (very high/low RD, extreme rating differences) need more test coverage

## Critical Code Quality Issues

This section provides a thorough analysis of production-readiness gaps that must be addressed in Phase 0. The codebase currently scores approximately **4.5/10** on production readiness.

### Production Readiness Summary

| Component | Score | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Database Models | 6/10 | NEEDS WORK |
| Session Management | 3/10 | CRITICAL |
| Pydantic Schemas | 5/10 | NEEDS WORK |
| Service Layer | 4/10 | CRITICAL |
| API Layer | 5/10 | NEEDS WORK |
| Test Coverage | 4/10 | INCOMPLETE |

### Database Models Issues

**Schema Design Problems:**

1. **Missing Timestamp Tracking** - `GameProfile`, `Match`, and `MatchParticipant` lack `created_at` and `updated_at` fields, making audit trails impossible for rating investigations.

2. **No Database Indexes** - No explicit indexes beyond primary/unique constraints. Queries filtering by `player_id`, `game_id`, `match_id` will perform full table scans at scale.
   ```python
   # Missing indexes needed on:
   # - GameProfile.player_id, GameProfile.game_id
   # - MatchParticipant.match_id, MatchParticipant.player_id
   # - Match.game_id
   ```

3. **Unvalidated JSON Fields** - `rating_info`, `stats`, `outcome`, and `match_metadata` accept any dict without structure validation. No TypedDict or schema enforcement.

4. **Rating Key Inconsistency** - The codebase uses inconsistent keys:
   - `glicko2_engine.py`: `rating`, `rd`, `vol`
   - Schema comments: `rating`, `rd`, `volatility`
   - This causes hidden bugs in rating updates.

5. **Inconsistent Cascade Behavior** - `Player.game_profiles` cascades on delete, but `Player.match_participations` does not, leaving orphaned records.

6. **No Soft Delete Support** - Hard deletes destroy match history integrity. No `deleted_at` field for any model.

### Session Management Issues (CRITICAL)

1. **Hardcoded Database URL:**
   ```python
   # Current (session.py)
   DATABASE_URL = "sqlite+aiosqlite:///./rankforge.db"

   # Should be:
   DATABASE_URL = os.getenv("DATABASE_URL", "sqlite+aiosqlite:///./rankforge.db")
   ```

2. **No Connection Pool Configuration:**
   ```python
   # Current
   engine = create_async_engine(DATABASE_URL)

   # Should be:
   engine = create_async_engine(
       DATABASE_URL,
       pool_size=20,
       max_overflow=10,
       pool_pre_ping=True,
   )
   ```

3. **Dangerous `expire_on_commit=False`** - Objects remain accessible after commit but may contain stale data.

4. **No Connection Lifecycle Management** - No disposal on shutdown, no graceful cleanup.

5. **Missing Error Handling in `get_db()`** - No try-except with explicit rollback on failure.

### Pydantic Schema Issues

1. **No Field Validation:**
   ```python
   # Current
   class PlayerCreate(PlayerBase):
       pass  # No validation

   # Should be:
   class PlayerCreate(PlayerBase):
       name: str = Field(..., min_length=2, max_length=100)
   ```

2. **Untyped `outcome` Field:**
   ```python
   # Current
   outcome: dict  # Accepts anything

   # Should be:
   class BinaryOutcome(BaseModel):
       result: Literal["win", "loss", "draw"]

   class RankedOutcome(BaseModel):
       rank: int = Field(..., ge=1)
   ```

3. **No `rating_strategy` Enum:**
   ```python
   # Should validate against implemented strategies:
   class RatingStrategy(str, Enum):
       GLICKO2 = "glicko2"
       DUMMY = "dummy"
   ```

4. **Missing Fields in Read Schemas** - `MatchParticipantRead` doesn't include `rating_info_before` and `rating_info_change`.

### Service Layer Issues (CRITICAL)

1. **Broken Transaction Atomicity:**
   ```python
   # Current flow in process_new_match():
   await db.commit()  # Line 85 - commits match data
   await glicko2_engine.update_ratings_for_match(db, new_match)  # Can fail!
   # If rating engine fails, match exists but ratings are wrong
   ```

   This means a match can be recorded without ratings being updated, leaving the system in an inconsistent state.

2. **No Participant Validation:**
   - No check for minimum 2 participants
   - No check for duplicate players
   - No validation of team structures
   - Empty participant lists accepted

3. **Hardcoded Default Ratings:**
   ```python
   DEFAULT_RATING_INFO = {"rating": 1500.0, "rd": 350.0, "vol": 0.06}
   # Should be configurable per-game
   ```

4. **Silent Failures in Rating Engine:**
   ```python
   # glicko2_engine.py
   if not profile:
       continue  # Silently skips missing profiles!
   ```

### API Layer Issues

1. **No Pagination:**
   ```python
   # Current - returns ALL records
   @router.get("/", response_model=list[match_schema.MatchRead])
   async def read_matches(...):
       query = select(Match).order_by(Match.id)  # No limit!
   ```

2. **Unhandled Database Exceptions:**
   ```python
   # Creating duplicate player throws IntegrityError, not HTTPException
   new_player = Player(**player_in.model_dump())
   await db.commit()  # Throws raw SQLAlchemy error
   ```

3. **Missing Core Endpoints:**
   - `GET /games/{game_id}/leaderboard`
   - `GET /players/{player_id}/stats`
   - `GET /players/{player_id}/matches`
   - `GET /health`
   - `PUT /matches/{match_id}` (update with cascade)

4. **No Idempotency Support** - Multiple identical POST requests create duplicates.

5. **No Request Logging** - Cannot audit API usage or debug production issues.

### Test Coverage Gaps

1. **No Error Scenario Tests:**
   - Duplicate player creation
   - Invalid game_id references
   - Missing game profiles

2. **No Transaction Rollback Tests:**
   - Partial failure scenarios
   - Database connection failures

3. **No Concurrency Tests:**
   - Simultaneous match creation
   - Race conditions on rating updates

4. **No Validation Tests:**
   - Invalid outcome formats
   - Invalid team structures
   - Empty participant lists

## Match Update Cascade: The Rating Recalculation Problem

Updating historical match data is one of the most architecturally challenging features in a rating system. When a match is corrected (wrong score, wrong players, wrong outcome), all subsequent ratings become invalid and must be recalculated.

### The Problem

Consider this scenario:
```
Match 1: Alice vs Bob → Alice wins → Alice: 1520, Bob: 1480
Match 2: Bob vs Carol → Bob wins → Bob: 1510, Carol: 1470
Match 3: Alice vs Carol → Carol wins → Alice: 1490, Carol: 1510

User discovers Match 1 was recorded wrong - Bob actually won.

Now what? All ratings are wrong:
- Match 1 recalc: Alice: 1480, Bob: 1520 (reversed)
- Match 2 recalc: Bob: 1550, Carol: 1470 (Bob started higher)
- Match 3 recalc: Alice: 1450, Carol: 1510 (Alice started lower)
```

Every match after the corrected one must be recalculated in chronological order, using the corrected ratings as inputs.

### Architectural Approaches

#### Approach 1: Full Forward Recalculation (Recommended for MVP)

**How it works:**
1. Identify the updated match's `played_at` timestamp
2. Query all matches for the same game with `played_at >= updated_match.played_at`
3. Reset all affected players' ratings to their state *before* the updated match
4. Replay all matches in chronological order, recalculating ratings

**Implementation:**
```python
async def recalculate_ratings_from_match(
    db: AsyncSession,
    match_id: int
) -> RecalculationResult:
    """
    Recalculate all ratings affected by updating a historical match.
    """
    match = await db.get(Match, match_id)
    game_id = match.game_id

    # 1. Get all matches from this point forward
    affected_matches = await db.execute(
        select(Match)
        .where(Match.game_id == game_id)
        .where(Match.played_at >= match.played_at)
        .order_by(Match.played_at)
    )

    # 2. Get all affected players
    affected_player_ids = set()
    for m in affected_matches:
        for p in m.participants:
            affected_player_ids.add(p.player_id)

    # 3. Reset ratings to "before" state of first affected match
    for player_id in affected_player_ids:
        profile = await get_game_profile(db, player_id, game_id)
        first_participation = get_first_participation(player_id, affected_matches)
        if first_participation.rating_info_before:
            profile.rating_info = first_participation.rating_info_before

    # 4. Replay all matches in order
    for m in affected_matches:
        await rating_engine.update_ratings_for_match(db, m)

    await db.commit()
    return RecalculationResult(matches_affected=len(affected_matches))
```

**Pros:**
- Simple to implement and understand
- Guarantees correctness
- No additional data structures needed

**Cons:**
- O(n) where n = matches after the update
- Slow for old matches in active games
- All-or-nothing operation

**Performance Characteristics:**
- 100 matches: < 1 second
- 1,000 matches: 5-10 seconds
- 10,000 matches: 1-2 minutes

**Mitigation:** For MVP with friends (likely < 500 total matches), this is perfectly acceptable.

#### Approach 2: Event Sourcing with Snapshots

**How it works:**
- Store all match events as immutable records
- Periodically create rating "snapshots" at checkpoints
- On update, find nearest snapshot before the change and replay forward

**Implementation Sketch:**
```python
class RatingSnapshot(Base):
    __tablename__ = "rating_snapshots"
    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)
    game_id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(ForeignKey("games.id"))
    snapshot_at: Mapped[datetime]
    ratings: Mapped[dict]  # {player_id: rating_info}
    match_id: Mapped[int]  # Last match included in snapshot
```

**Pros:**
- Can limit recalculation to snapshot intervals
- Enables "what-if" analysis without mutation
- Full audit trail

**Cons:**
- Significantly more complex
- Additional storage requirements
- Snapshot management overhead

**Recommendation:** Defer to post-MVP.

#### Approach 3: Incremental Delta Recalculation

**How it works:**
- Track rating deltas per match, not absolute ratings
- On update, calculate new deltas and propagate changes

**Why it doesn't work for Glicko-2:**
- Glicko-2 is non-linear (RD and volatility interact)
- Can't simply add/subtract deltas
- Each calculation depends on opponent ratings at that moment

**Recommendation:** Not viable for this rating system.

### Implementation Plan for Match Updates

**Phase 0 Tasks (Foundation):**

| Task | Hours | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Add `updated_at` timestamps to all models | 2 | Track when records change |
| Create `MatchUpdate` schema with validation | 3 | Define what can/cannot be updated |
| Implement optimistic locking | 2 | Prevent concurrent update conflicts |
| Add match versioning/audit table | 4 | Track change history |

**Phase 1 Tasks (Core Implementation):**

| Task | Hours | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Implement rating snapshot storage | 4 | Store rating state before each match |
| Build forward recalculation service | 8 | Core algorithm implementation |
| Create `PUT /matches/{id}` endpoint | 4 | API with validation and cascade trigger |
| Add recalculation progress tracking | 3 | For long-running operations |
| Build rollback capability | 4 | Undo failed recalculations |
| Comprehensive test suite | 6 | Edge cases, concurrent updates |

**Total: ~40 hours**

### Validation Rules for Match Updates

To prevent invalid updates that would corrupt the rating system:

1. **Immutable After Threshold:**
   ```python
   MAX_UPDATE_AGE_DAYS = 30  # Configurable
   if (datetime.now() - match.played_at).days > MAX_UPDATE_AGE_DAYS:
       raise MatchTooOldToUpdateError()
   ```

2. **Cannot Change Game:**
   ```python
   if update.game_id and update.game_id != match.game_id:
       raise CannotChangeMatchGameError()
   ```

3. **Player Changes Require Full Recalculation:**
   ```python
   if set(update.player_ids) != set(original.player_ids):
       # Must recalculate from this match forward
       requires_cascade = True
   ```

4. **Concurrent Update Protection:**
   ```python
   if match.version != update.expected_version:
       raise ConcurrentModificationError()
   ```

5. **Outcome Validation:**
   ```python
   if not is_valid_outcome(update.outcome, match.game):
       raise InvalidOutcomeError()
   ```

### User Experience Considerations

1. **Warning Before Cascade:**
   ```
   "Updating this match will recalculate ratings for 47 subsequent matches.
    This may take up to 30 seconds. Continue?"
   ```

2. **Progress Indication:**
   - Show recalculation progress for large cascades
   - Allow background processing with notification on completion

3. **Preview Changes:**
   - Show rating diffs before confirming update
   - "Alice: 1520 → 1485 (-35), Bob: 1480 → 1515 (+35)"

4. **Audit Log:**
   - Record who changed what, when
   - Enable undo within a time window

### Data Flow for Key Operations

**Recording a Match (Target Flow After Phase 0A):**
```
User → Frontend Form → POST /matches/ → match_service.process_new_match()
  → Begin transaction
  → Create Match + MatchParticipant records
  → get_or_create_game_profile() for each player
  → Store rating_info_before
  → Dispatch to rating engine (glicko2_engine.update_ratings_for_match)
  → Calculate new ratings per Glicko-2 algorithm
  → Update GameProfile.rating_info
  → Store rating_info_change
  → Commit entire transaction (match + ratings atomically)
  → Return complete Match object → Frontend displays result
```
*Note: Current implementation incorrectly commits before rating calculation. See Phase 0A for fix.*

**Matchmaking (Planned):**
```
User → Select players + constraints → POST /matchmaking/generate
  → Fetch all players' GameProfiles for selected game
  → Create skill distributions per player (Gaussian from rating + RD)
  → Generate possible team configurations
  → Evaluate each configuration:
    → Superposition team distributions
    → Calculate fairness score (overlap of team distributions)
  → Simulated annealing optimization
    → Start with random configuration
    → Perturb and accept/reject based on temperature schedule
  → Return top N configurations → Frontend displays options
```

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 0: Foundation Refactoring & Production-Quality Standards
**Goal:** Aggressively refactor existing code to production-quality standards before adding new features. This phase is critical—building on a weak foundation will compound technical debt.

**Production-Quality Standards We're Targeting:**
- All database operations are atomic and properly handle failures
- All API inputs are validated with meaningful error messages
- All JSON fields have typed schemas
- Connection management is production-ready
- Test coverage > 85% with error scenario coverage
- No silent failures anywhere in the codebase

#### Phase 0 Summary

| Sub-Phase | Hours | Focus |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| 0A: Critical Infrastructure | 10 | Must fix first |
| 0B: Data Layer | 50 | Models, schemas, services |
| 0C: API Layer | 27 | Endpoints, error handling |
| 0D: Test Coverage | 22 | Comprehensive testing |
| 0E: Dev Environment | 13 | Docker, cleanup |
| **Total** | **122** | **20-40 weeks at 3-6 hrs/week** |

**Recommended Approach:** Complete Phase 0A first (2-3 weeks), then work through 0B-0E in parallel where possible. The data layer work (0B) should be prioritized as other work depends on it.

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] All critical infrastructure issues resolved
- [ ] Database schema includes indexes, timestamps, versioning
- [ ] All JSON fields have typed schemas with validation
- [ ] Transaction atomicity verified with tests
- [ ] API returns proper errors for all failure cases
- [ ] Pagination works on all list endpoints
- [ ] Test coverage > 85%
- [ ] Docker development environment functional
- [ ] Zero silent failures in codebase
- [ ] All TODO comments replaced with implementations

**Code That Should Be Rewritten (Not Just Refactored):**

1. **match_service.process_new_match()** - Transaction handling is fundamentally broken. Needs complete rewrite with proper atomic boundaries.

2. **get_db() in session.py** - Needs rewrite with error handling, proper lifecycle management, and configuration.

3. **All Pydantic schemas** - Current approach of `pass` in child classes provides no value. Need complete redesign with proper validation.

4. **Error handling throughout** - No consistent pattern exists. Need custom exception hierarchy and global handler.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Rating System Architecture

**Current Implementation: Glicko-2**

Located in [glicko2_engine.py](src/rankforge/rating/glicko2_engine.py), the implementation follows Mark Glickman's paper exactly:

```python
@dataclass
class Glicko2Rating:
    mu: float = 1500.0      # Rating (skill estimate)
    phi: float = 350.0      # Rating Deviation (uncertainty)
    sigma: float = 0.06     # Volatility (consistency)
```

**Key Algorithm Steps:**
1. Convert to Glicko-2 scale (divide by 173.7178)
2. Compute estimated variance `v`
3. Compute estimated improvement `delta`
4. Determine new volatility `sigma'` via bisection method
5. Update rating deviation to pre-rating period value
6. Update rating and rating deviation
7. Convert back to Glicko scale

**Score Calculation:**
- Binary outcomes: win=1.0, loss=0.0, draw=0.5
- Ranked outcomes: normalized by (numOpponents - (rank-1)) / numOpponents
- Each player rated against all opponents on opposing teams

**Extension Points:**
- New rating engines implement `update_ratings_for_match(db, match)` function
- Game's `rating_strategy` field routes to appropriate engine
- Engines can be hot-swapped without schema changes

### Matchmaking Algorithm (Planned)

**Core Concept: Skill Distribution Superposition**

Each player's skill is modeled as a Gaussian distribution:
```
Player_i ~ N(μ_i, σ_i)
where μ = rating, σ = rating_deviation
```

A team's skill is the sum of player skills (superposition):
```
Team ~ N(Σμ_i, √(Σσ_i²))
```

**Fairness Scoring:**

The fairness of a matchup is the probability that teams are evenly matched, calculated as the overlap of team distributions:
```
Fairness = P(|Team1 - Team2| < threshold)
         = area under min(pdf_Team1_wins, pdf_Team2_wins)
```

Higher overlap = more uncertain outcome = more balanced match.

**Simulated Annealing Optimization:**

For N players forming M teams:
1. Initialize random valid configuration
2. Set temperature T = T_max
3. While T > T_min:
   - Perturb: swap two random players between teams
   - Calculate ΔFairness
   - If improved: accept
   - If worse: accept with probability exp(ΔFairness/T)
   - Cool: T = T * cooling_rate
4. Return best configuration found

**Configuration:**
```python
DEFAULT_MATCHMAKING_CONFIG = {
    "T_max": 1.0,
    "T_min": 0.001,
    "cooling_rate": 0.99,
    "iterations_per_temp": 10,
    "num_results": 5,  # Return top N configurations
}
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for all business logic functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Test coverage target: >80%
- All async code tested with pytest-asyncio
- Use in-memory SQLite for test isolation

**Documentation Standards:**
- Docstrings for all public functions/classes
- Type hints on all function signatures
- Complex algorithms explained in comments
- README updated for new features

**Code Review Process:**
- All changes via pull request
- At least one review before merge (even for solo development - use self-review checklist)
- CI must pass before merge
- Squash merge for clean history

**Linting/Formatting:**
- Ruff for linting (E, F, I rules)
- Ruff for formatting (88 char line length, double quotes)
- Mypy for type checking (strict mode)
- Pre-commit hooks enforce on every commit

### Git Workflow

**Branching Strategy:**
```
main (protected)
  └── feature/matchmaking-algorithm

**Commit Message Convention:**
```
type(scope): short description

Longer explanation if needed.

Closes #123
```

Types: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore

**PR Requirements:**

## Timeline & Milestones

### Realistic Schedule (3-6 hours/week)

| Phase | Duration | Hours | Target Completion |
|-------|----------|-------|-------------------|
| Phase 0: Foundation Refactoring | 20-40 weeks | 122 | Week 40 |
| Phase 1: Matchmaking + Match Updates | 12-20 weeks | 79-89 | Week 60 |
| Phase 2: Frontend | 10-21 weeks | 50-64 | Week 81 |
| Phase 3: Deployment | 6-13 weeks | 30-38 | Week 94 |
| Phase 4: Documentation | 5-12 weeks | 28-35 | Week 106 |

**Total: ~309-348 hours over 18-24 months**

*Note: Phase 0 is significantly larger than originally estimated due to critical technical debt. This investment is necessary—building features on a broken foundation would multiply problems later.*

**Phase 0 Breakdown:**
| Sub-Phase | Hours | Can Parallelize? |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| 0A: Critical Infrastructure | 10 | No - do first |
| 0B: Data Layer | 50 | Yes, after 0A |
| 0C: API Layer | 27 | Yes, after 0A |
| 0D: Test Coverage | 22 | Yes, alongside 0B/0C |
| 0E: Dev Environment | 13 | Yes, anytime |

**Phase 1 now includes Match Update Cascade:**
| Component | Hours |
|-----------|-------|
| Original matchmaking work | 39-49 |
| Match update cascade implementation | 40 |
| Total | 79-89 |

### Key Milestones

   - Portfolio presentation complete

### Contingency Planning

**Buffer Time:**
- Each phase includes ~20% buffer in estimates
- Phase 3 and 4 can be compressed if behind schedule
- MVP can be redefined to ship faster

**Risk Mitigation:**

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Matchmaking algorithm complexity | High | Start simple, iterate |
| Frontend learning curve | Medium | Follow tutorials, use component libraries |
| Deployment issues | Medium | Use PaaS (Railway/Render) to minimize DevOps |
| Scope creep | High | Strict MVP definition, defer features |
| Burnout | High | Sustainable 3-6 hrs/week, celebrate milestones |
