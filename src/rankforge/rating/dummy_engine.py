    A placeholder rating update function.

    This dummy implementation will eventually be replaced by real rating engines
    like Glicko-2. Its purpose is to prove that the service layer can
    correctly call a rating update function after a match is created.

    This dummy implementation finds the GameProfile for each participant and
    increments their 'matches_played' stat. This proves the end-to-end
    pipeline from service to engine to database update.
